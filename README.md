# Closed_loop_Res_manage

This (Jupyter/Python) notebook presents a tutorial on history matching (using ensemble methods), data optimazation (using ensemble methods) and finally using EnKF and EnOpt in Closed-Loop Reservoir Management.

In this (Jupyter notebook) EnKF and EnOpt are based on:

A. J. Hong , R. B. Bratvold, G. Nævdal, Robust production optimization with capacitance-resistance model as precursor: https://doi.org/10.1007/S10596-017-9666-8

This tutorial is based on "Tutorial on ensemble history matching and optimisation"jupyter notebook by Patrick N. Raanes: https://github.com/patricknraanes

This work has been developed by Siavash Heydari, MSc at the University of Stavanger. The project has been funded by UiS as a summer project.



# Install Anaconda.

Open the Anaconda terminal (Anaconda Prompt) and run the following commands:

1>conda create --yes --name my-env python=3.7

2>conda activate my-env

Keep using the same terminal for the commands below.

Use files in this folder or download and unzip (or git clone) HistoryMatching repository

In Anaconda terminal use:
3> cd "path/to" (folder
command to change the directory to location you saved the "HistoryMatching repository").

4>pip install -r "path/to/"requirements.txt

Launch the "notebook server" by executing: 
5>jupyter notebook

If the set up goes correct, for next times there is no need to do mentioned steps, otherwise in Anaconda terminal continue from 2nd step for each time.

and following steps.

Finally open file “CLRM.ipynb”.
If “CLRM.py” causes an error, delete it.
